## Link to Project : https://mlops-house-price.herokuapp.com/
Note: It might take a minute to load. Server goes to "rest state" after some time

The goal if this project is to run a Machine Learning model on the cloud.

<br/>
# :rocket: Tech Stack 
Docker, Github Action, XGBoost, Flask, Heroku (cloud provider)
<br/>
<br/>
Everytime the main branch of this repo is updated, the app will be automatically reloaded on the cloud
<br/>
<br/>
Quick Note: Heroku memory is very limited, this is the reason my package imports are unusual in app.py. I hope it helps

## Thank You
